## Booting Procedure 
Realised the boot strap procedure and booting procedure of Xv6 OS on QEMU(OS Emulator)

## Enhancing console and infrastructure to calculate time of scheduling policies
Enhanced the existing basic console in Xv6 to make it work similar to modern commandline and also created the infrastructure to able to calculate the time statistics of various scheduling policies

## Making System Calls 
Implemented system calls and user-level programs to get info of processes and functioning of Xv6 Operating System

## Process Management and Sceduling Policies
Implemented hybrid scheduling algorithms like SJF + Round Robin for the OS kernel and studied them using system calls

## Memory Management 
Implemented lazy memory allocation,virtual memory mapping: page allocation and swapping mechanisms
